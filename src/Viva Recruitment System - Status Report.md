## Critical Issue: Application Form Submission

### Problem Description
The application form on the `/apply` page is **not submitting successfully** even when all required fields are completed.

### Symptoms
- Form accepts input for all fields (Full Name, Email, Phone, Years of Experience)
- Specializations and equipment checkboxes can be selected
- Submit button is clickable
- **No error message is displayed** to the user
- **No success message is displayed**
- Form remains on the same page after clicking Submit
- No network request appears to be sent to the server

### Form Structure Verified
The form includes:
- ✅ Full Name field (filled: "Sarah Johnson")
- ✅ Email field (filled: "sarah.johnson@example.com")
- ✅ Phone field (filled: "+44 7700 123456")
- ✅ Years of Experience field (filled: "8")
- ✅ Profession selection (selected: "Massage Therapist")
- ✅ Specializations checkboxes (selected: Deep Tissue, Swedish Massage)
- ✅ Mobile experience checkbox
- ✅ Availability textarea (filled: "Monday-Friday 9am-5pm, Central London")
- ✅ Equipment checkboxes (selected: Massage Table, Massage Oils)
- ✅ Document upload fields (optional, left empty)

### Database Status
- No new candidates were created after form submission attempts
- Database query shows 0 total candidates and NULL latest application timestamp
- This confirms the form submission is not reaching the backend

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue appears to be in the **client-side form submission logic**. Possible causes:

1. **Form Validation Blocking:** The ApplicationFormComponent has client-side validation that may be preventing submission
   - Requires: fullName, email, profession, at least one specialization, at least one equipment
   - All these requirements were met in the test

2. **Missing Event Handler:** The form's onSubmit handler may not be properly attached or triggered

3. **State Management Issue:** React state may not be properly updated when form fields are filled

4. **Network/API Issue:** The tRPC endpoint `candidates.create` may not be properly configured

5. **Browser Console Errors:** No errors visible in console, but there may be silent failures

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Priority 1)
1. **Debug Form Submission**
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors (may need to open DevTools)
   - Verify tRPC client is properly configured
   - Test API endpoint directly with curl/Postman
   - Check server logs for API errors

2. **Verify tRPC Connection**
   - Ensure `candidates.create` endpoint is properly exposed
   - Check if mutation is being called on form submit
   - Verify input validation schema in routers.ts

3. **Test API Endpoint**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/trpc/candidates.create \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "fullName": "Test User",
       "email": "test@example.com",
       "phone": "+44 7700 000000",
       "profession": "Massage Therapist",
       "yearsExperience": 5,
       "specializations": "[\"Deep Tissue\"]",
       "equipment": "[\"Massage Table\"]",
       "hasMobileExperience": true,
       "availability": "Monday-Friday"
     }'
   ```

### Short-term (Priority 2)
1. **Test Candidate Portal** - Verify email verification and access control
2. **Test Document Uploads** - Ensure file upload functionality works
3. **Verify Email Configuration** - Check EmailJS integration for notifications
4. **Test Office Portal Features** - Add candidate, search, filter, update status

### Medium-term (Priority 3)
1. Implement missing features from knowledge base:
   - WhatsApp integration
   - Document verification queue
   - Readiness checklist
   - Applicant progress dashboard
   - Email communication templates

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate Form Submission Issue** (URGENT)
   - This is blocking the entire application workflow
   - Check ApplicationFormComponent.tsx for validation logic
   - Verify ApplyForm.tsx tRPC mutation setup
   - Test with browser DevTools open to catch errors

2. **Create Test Candidate** (via API or Database)
   - Insert a test candidate directly into the database to verify office portal works
   - This will help isolate whether the issue is frontend-only

3. **Document All Features** 
   - Once form submission is fixed, test all other features
   - Create comprehensive testing checklist

4. **Deploy to Production**
   - After all issues are resolved
   - Set up proper error logging and monitoring

## Conclusion

The Viva Recruitment system is **structurally sound** with proper database schema and working website infrastructure. However, the **application form submission is non-functional**, which is a critical blocker for the recruitment workflow. This issue must be resolved immediately before the system can be used for accepting applications.

The database schema is correctly aligned with the Drizzle ORM definitions, and no database-level issues were found. The problem is purely in the frontend form submission logic or the tRPC API integration.

**Estimated Time to Fix:** 1-2 hours once the exact cause is identified through debugging.
