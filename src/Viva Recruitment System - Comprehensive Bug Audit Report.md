## Critical Issue Remaining

### Application Form Database Insertion
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Component:** Application Form (Public)  
**Issue:** Form submission fails due to Drizzle ORM schema mismatch with database table structure

**Details:**
- The schema definition includes columns that don't exist in the actual database
- Direct SQL inserts work perfectly (verified)
- Drizzle ORM is caching old schema definition
- This prevents public candidates from submitting applications

**Workaround:**
- Office staff can add candidates manually through the Office Portal Add Candidate form
- The form UI and validation are fully functional
- Only the database persistence layer needs synchronization

**Resolution Path:**
1. Verify actual database table structure
2. Update Drizzle schema to match exactly
3. Clear ORM cache
4. Test form submission

## Recommendations for Production

- Office Portal (fully functional)
- Candidate Portal (fully functional)
- Available Positions page
- Induction Checklist

### ⚠️ REQUIRES ATTENTION BEFORE FULL DEPLOYMENT:
